Data that are used are a generated dataset of historial lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending service company.(The dataset is generated by edX Boot Camps LLC.)
The dataset is separated randomly into a testing dataset and a training dataset using the train_test_split() function from the Sklearn library.
For the evaluation of the analysis, confusion_matrix() and classification_report() functions from Sklearn are used.
