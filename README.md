# credit-risk-classification report
## Analysis Overview
The analysis is intended to test whether Sklearn Logistic Regression Model is adequate to provide a prediction of the risks of the loans. Data that are used are a generated dataset of historial lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending service company.(The dataset is generated by edX Boot Camps LLC.)
The dataset is separated randomly into a testing dataset and a training dataset using the train_test_split() function from the Sklearn library.
For the evaluation of the analysis, confusion_matrix() and classification_report() functions from Sklearn are used.

## Result
* Precision Score of healthy risk(0): 0.99 <br />
  A relatively high precision score, which means that the model is very good at predicting borrowers with healthy loan risk.
* Precision Score of high risk(1): 0.91 <br />
  A relatively good precision score, which means that the model is good at predicting borrowers with high risk loan borrowers.
* Recall Score of healthy risk(0): 1.00 <br />
  A almost perfect recall score, which means that the model retrieves almost all healthy risk loan borrowers.
* Recall Score of high risk(1): 0.85 <br />
  A reltively decent recall score, wich means that the model is likely to retrieves 85% of the high risk loan borrowers.
* Accuracy: 0.99 <br />
  The accuracy score tells us that the model is at approximately 99% at prediction the loan risk of borrowers. <br /><br />

## Summary
From the accuracy score, we can conclude that the model is relatively good at predicting loan risks. If we look at the precision score and recall score of healthy risk loans, the model seems to be good at predicting the borrowers with healthy loan risks. However, the precision score and recall score
for high-risk loan borrowers are relatively lower than the scores of the healthy-risk loan borrowers. <br />
Even though 0.91 and 0.85 are decent scores for precision score and recall score, I would argue that the logistic regression model is not adequate enough to be used. As a peer-to-peer lending service, we care more about high-risk loan borrowers. However, from the recall score,
we can tell that the model is missing approximately 15% of the high-risk borrowers. This implies that there will be a possible risk (15%) of making false predictions of spotting high loan-risk borrowers if we use the model to predict loan risk. This risk is relatively high. In the long term, this might cause the company to be less profitable than it should be.
Therefore, I argue that the Sklearn logistic regression model is not adequate enough for the task of predicting loan risks.
